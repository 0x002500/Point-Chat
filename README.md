# Point-Chat

Point-Chat is a real-time chat application that uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live message updates and a basic HTTP server for handling chat messages. This project demonstrates a simple chat application with live updates, implemented in Node.js.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **CORS Support**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow interactions from different origins.
- **Message Broadcasting**: All messages are broadcasted to all connected clients.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: Implemented using Node.js with the `http` and `events` modules.
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for interacting with the chat server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/point-chat.git
   cd point-chat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   This project does not have any additional dependencies, but ensure you have Node.js installed.

### Running the Server

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Open the Frontend**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Usage

1. **Enter Username**: Type your username into the input field.
2. **Type a Message**: Write your message in the text area.
3. **Send Message**: Click the "Send Message" button or press Enter to send the message.

Messages will be displayed in real-time in the message area.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /messageChannel**: Establishes an SSE connection for receiving real-time messages.
- **POST /sendMessage**: Accepts a JSON payload with `user` and `message` fields. Broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

### Example Request to POST /sendMessage

```json
POST http://localhost:8080/sendMessage
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user": "Alice",
  "message": "Hello, world!"
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "Message sent to all clients"
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Invalid JSON**: Returns a 400 status code with an error message if the JSON payload is invalid.
- **Other Errors**: Returns a 404 status code for unknown routes.
